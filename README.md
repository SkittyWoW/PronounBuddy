# Pronoun Buddy
*Hiii, thanks so much for liking my addon, I originally created the addon, so that the people in my guild would stop misgendering me, but also so I didnt accidentally misgender someone else.* 

---

## Addon Description
This addon allows the user to set specific pronouns, for their character in game. It shows up in chat boxes and on their unit frames, however only shows with others in your guild who have the addon. :)

---

## Where pronouns appear
Once you have set the pronouns, they will be displayed
- In the Target Frame *When someone targets you, they'll see your name with your pronouns*
- In Chat Messages *Your pronouns appear in guild chat, party chat, raid chat, and whispers*
- For Other Players *You'll see pronouns of any guild member who has set them*

Example of what others see
`Sophia (She/Her): Good Morning Guildies!`

## How it works
---
### Setting your Pronouns
Simply type `/pronouns` follow by your preferred pronouns
`/pronouns she/her
/pronouns he/him
/pronouns they/them
/pronouns she/they
/pronouns any
/pronouns he/they
/pronouns ask me
`
You can use any text you prefer - the addon is flexible

### Sharing with your guild

When you set your pronouns, PronounBuddy Automatically shares them with your guild members who also have the addon installed. 
This happens:
- When you first set your pronouns
- When you log into the game
- When you manually sync using `/pronounsync`

## Technical Details

---

### How the Communication Works
- Pronoun uses World of Warcraft's built-in addon communication system
- Pronouns are shared through the guild channel only
- Each player's pronouns are stored locally in your WoW SavedVariables folder
- No external servers or websites are involved - everything happens within WoW

### What gets saved?
- Your own pronouns
- Pronouns of guild members who have shared them
- This data persists between logging out.

### Installation
`Download via CurseForge`

### Command List
`/pronouns [text]` Sets your pronouns
`/pronounsync` Re-Broadcast your pronouns to the guild
